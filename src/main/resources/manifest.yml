# This is a Custom Manifest for automatic plugin management.
# It should be manually edited, and PlugMan will do its best to follow it.
# The format is as follows:
#   - name: <plugin-name>
#     type: <type> "spigot" or "direct" // we may support GitHub later
#     id-or-url: <id-or-url> (id for spigot plugins, url for direct plugins, or GitHub repo)
#     target-version: <version> (only used for spigot or github plugins, ignored for direct, defaults to latest)
# The plugin will attempt to download and install the plugin from the URL.
# If the plugin is already installed, it will be updated to the target version.
# Plugins that are in the ignored-plugins list in config.yml will be ignored.
#
# This file should be used carefully, as it can install plugins that are not
# yet verified, or install incompatible versions. (only use this manifest with plugins you deeply trust)
# PlugMan will only download plugins that will be initialized on the next server start.
